## Tree algorithims

- Tree basics
- Binary search tree
- Red-black tree

Tree: key가 있는 노드와 유사함

: insert delete search : basic operation

|  | INSERT / DELELTE | SEARCH |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sorted arrays |  O(n) |  O(log n) |
| sorted linked lists | O(1) |  O(n) |
| Binary search tress | O(logn) | O(logn) |
|  |  |  |

O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) 순으로 오래걸린다는 뜻이며, O(n) worst case로 이해함

각 이유에 대해서도 말할 수 있어야함.

### Free tree

1. 연결되어 있음
2. cycle 없음

= > **connected acyclic undirected graph :**

이유에 대해 설명하기

### Rooted Tree

rooted tree → free tree → graph : graph의 범주에 tree, rooted tree가 포함되어있음 

- each node: parent-child 구조 , ancstor-descendant relationships
- root node : no parent / ancestor only child

### Binary tree terminology

- all keys are distinct ← each node has a pointer ( left, right child, parent)
- 

### Binary search trees

- binary tree
    - **Every LEFT descendant** of a node has key less than that node.
    - **Every RIGHT descendant** of a node has key larger than that node.
- Binary search tree : implement this! - 코드숙지할 것

### SEARCH

- How LONG ? : O(length og longest path) = O(height)

### INSERT

- INSERT(KEY)
    1. x= search(key)
    2. if key > x.key → right node : x의 child
    3. if key < x.key → left node : x 의 child
    4. if key == x.key : return ( unique 한 값이라고 가정!) 
    

### DELETE

- DELETE (key)
    1. x= search (key)
    2. if x.key==key:
    3. delete key ⇒ 이후 BST의 형태 조정 필요
        - case 1: if x is a **leaf** , just delete it
        - case 2: if have one child, move that up
        - case 3: if have two childre, successor
            - how to serrch succesor?: 3 right보다 작은 값으로 집어넣을 값을 찾아야함 ( x 이후 가장 작은 값으로 결정)
        

- O(n) 일 경우 → tree의 형태를 바꿔줄 필요가 있음 ( 불필요하게 tree node 갯수만큼의 height 가질때) ; height를 줄이자

### FOR Fast   ( Self Balancing !)

1. Tree rotation ? height를 줄이자 : balanced될때까지 계속 rotation ㄱ ㄱ 
2. have some proxy for balance : balanced한 상태가 언제?
    1. some property : satisfy : what? ⇒ “ RED BLACK TREES”
3. **Red black trees**

### Red black trees RULES

- binary search tree에서 추가적인 특성이 있음
1. 모든 노드는 red or black
2. root node : **black** 
3. NIL children count **black**
4. Red node’s children : black
5. For nodex X to NIL’s 까지 → black nodes의 갯수가 전부 같아야함
- black nodes : balanced
- red nodes: spread out

⇒ the height of red-black tree : 대부분 2.. log (n)

### Red black trees when INSERTION

- height : ≤ 2*  floor (log n ) +1
- CASES
    - 1 : Make a new red node
    - 2 : insert it as you would normally
    - 3: fix things up if needed→ for balanced
        
        → context 고려해서 fix ( 해당 node가 Red인지, black인지에 따라 context 파악 가능) 
        
        - red node: 자식 1 or 2 있음
        - black node : NIL

### Red black trees when DELETE

- if node : BLACK:
    - we have address each case that (p,s,l,r) has distinct color combination **

### What are the properties of an RB tree?

### And (more important) why does that guarantee that
they are balanced?

- Red-Black Trees always have height at most 2log(n+1).
- As with general Binary Search Trees, all operations are O(height)
- So all operations are O(log(n)).
